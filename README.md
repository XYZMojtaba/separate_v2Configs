This guide will walk you through the steps to use my awesome project to simplify your life.

## Step 1: Navigate to the Desired Directory

First, navigate to the directory where you want to download and run the script. For example:

```bash
termux-setup-storage && cd ~/storage/shared/Download
```

## Step 2: Download and Run the Script

Next, download and run the script using the following command:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XYZMojtaba/separate_v2Configs/main/my_script.sh && bash ./my_script.sh
```

## Step 3: Enter the Input File Name

After executing the script, you will be prompted to enter the name of your input file along with its extension. For example, if your file is named `example.txt`, enter `example.txt` when prompted.

## Step 4: Confirm Configuration Categories

Once you've entered the input file name, the script will categorize the configurations based on the supported types:

- vmess
- vless
- ss
- wireguard

## Step 5: Enjoy Organized Configuration Files

After confirming the configuration types, the script will organize the configurations into separate files based on their types. You can now easily manage and use your v2ray configuration files!
